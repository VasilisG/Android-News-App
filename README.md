# Android-News-App
This is an Android news app made in Android Studio and it's my first Android project.

It uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to retrieve and extract news sources and headlines from JSON objects.

## Features

- A wide range of the international news agencies to browse headlines from.
- The ability to choose and filter the news agencies you want to view, based on news category, country and language.
- The ability to mark and store your favourite news sources in order to keep them separately from the other and access them more easily.
- Automatically saving the 10 more recently viewed headlines.
- Option to share this app.
